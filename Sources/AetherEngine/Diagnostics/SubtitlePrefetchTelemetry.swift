/// allowance while the pump stayed exactly paced. That is visible on the wire minutes before
/// the process dies, so it has to be visible in our own log too: `lead` separates "reads fast

/// packet, never per demuxed packet) and read by the 30 s memprobe on the main actor. The
/// generation guard keeps a cancelled session's exit from clearing the successor it was
/// replaced by: `startSubtitleForwardPrefetcher` cancels and restarts in the same call, and
/// the outgoing loop can still be unwinding when the new one begins.
